# Health Care Analytics Pipeline
The purpose of this project is to develop and deploy a scalable system for the data science lifecycle in health care use cases using the Synthethic Public Use file curated and made publically available by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services. Production version is be deployed in a cloud-based architecture (AWS) adhering to design principles and best practices for implementing large-scale systems for data ingestion, processing, storage, and analytics. The pipeline includes:
*  an end to end process of gathering, preparing data for ML Modeling.
* collaboration with the team on business use case, data preparation and analysis
* Connecting to databases, analyzing the data and deriving valuable insights using Spark
* Build, train machine learning models and deploy them into production environment

## Project goals (MSDS 436 - Course Objectives)
* Select appropriate infrastructure for large data processing, storage and analytics
* Process data and architect an end-to-end pipeline in a cloud environment
* Architect an end-to-end solution to deploy a machine learning model into production
* Review formats and protocols for application programming interfaces
* Utilize High Performance Computing for distributed in-memory processing of large datas
* Package, distribute and orchestrate containerized applications

## Software objectives
* Modular: components are modular/isolated to ensure use-case/stack flexibility
* Automated: maximal steps from ingestion to deployment are automated
* Modern stack: Technology must be modern, useful, and widely adopted
